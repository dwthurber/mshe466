						<h2>Education: Publicizing Your Degrees</h2>
						<h3>Which should I list first - education or experience?</h3>
						<p>Unless you are a career advancer with several years of relevant experience, andyour MSHE degree is simply an added bonus, “Education” should probably be the first section of your resume. You’ve invested time and money in this degree; it’s important to market it!</p>
						<h3>How should I write MSHE?</h3>
						<p>Write out the full name and include the university, city, and state. Also include your graduation month and year even if it is anticipated graduation for the future.</p>
						<h3>Should I include anything else?</h3>
						<p><strong>Master’s Project:</strong> Title or, if title isn’t relevant to job target, use a description of the project, written with your desired audience in mind</p>
						<p><strong>Relevant courses:</strong> List only if particularly relevant to target position and only if you’re willing to talk about them in an interview.</p>
						<p><strong>GPA:</strong> Typically, GPA is unnecessary at this point in your career. If you choose to include it, do so for both undergrad and grad school so that you don’t raise a question in the employer’s mind by including it in only one place.</p>
						<p><strong>Honors:</strong> Feel free to list honors. If you list cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude, these Latin words should be in lowercase and italicized.</p>

						<h2>Experience: Telling the Story of What you Want to Do</h2>
						<h3>How do I know which jobs to include, and how do I organize them?</h3>
						<p>Include employment since your undergraduate graduation or the last 10 years – whichever is shorter.</p>
						<p>Typically, recruiters like to see positions listed in reverse chronological order. To ensure that all your relevant experiences are seen first, you may choose to group experiences under two headings – Higher Education Experience and Additional Experience. If you have enough experience in your targeted career area, you can make your heading even more specific (e.g., Career Services Experience, International Education Experience, or Enrollment Management Experience may precede Additional Experience).

						<h2>Bulleted Descriptions: Proving Your Abilities and Achievements</h2>
						<h3>How do I write compelling bullet points?</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Start with powerful, action verbs. Avoid repetition and phrases like, “Responsible for…”</li>
							<li>Quantify your work whenever possible.</li>
							<li>Include the impact and/or results of your work. Bullets written as accomplishments, rather than duties, pack a bigger punch.</li>
							<li>Prioritize bullets not according to how much time you spent on a particular task or the order of importance to your current job, but according to each bullet’s relevance to your desired position.</li>
							<li>Omit any tasks (e.g., answered phone, input data) that you do not want to do in the future or that brand you as a lower-level employee if you are applying for an upper-level position.</li>

						<h2>Research & Presentations: Conveying Your Analytical Skills</h2>
						<h3>Do I have to list research and/or presentations?</h3><p>No! This is a great section to include if you have done research of which you are particularly proud and/or if you’re applying to research-oriented positions. It’s not, however, a necessary section of a resume. Be careful about including a long list of research and presentations, in fact, as that might make employers think you were hoping to go the academic, as opposed to administrative, route.</p>

						<h2>Additional Experience: Articulating the Relevance</h2>
						<h3>How do I include experience that is unrelated to my job target?</h3>
						<p>You have a couple different options. If you have enough relevant experience and content in other areas of your resume, the additional experience section can just be a listing of employer, city/state, title, and employment dates, without a description of your tasks.</p>
						<p>For most people, though, descriptions are necessary. Be sure to write these descriptions with your audience in mind. How does your past experience relate to your desired job? How can you re-frame your experience to connect with your potential employer?

						<h2>Skills & Interests: Rounding Out the Resume</h2>
						<h3>What skills and interests should I include?</h3>
						<p><strong>Language:</strong> Include languages only if you’re at least proficient.</p>
						<p><strong>Computer:</strong> Include any programs you’ve used, especially if they are listed as a requirement in the job description for which you’re applying. Don’t think that people just assume you have these skills; recruiters want to see them listed.</p>
						<p><strong>Interests:</strong> Include interests if you think it could lead to good small talk at the beginning of an interview and/or if the interests are somewhat memorable/unique. Challenge yourself to be able to answer, “Why would you include this on your resume?” or “How does this relate to the job for which you’ve applied?” Has the interest provided you with a transferable skill or enabled you to demonstrate a particular personality trait that would be helpful in your desired role? If you can’t answer these questions, don’t include the interest on your resume.</p>
